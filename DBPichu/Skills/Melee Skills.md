Melee Skills can either do several hits individually, or add them all into a single hit.
You learn them by talking to various NPCs, or by doing quests. Some basic melee skills can be learned by training yourself enough, but most are earned by meeting new masters. Some melee skills hit really hard, perhaps enough to break through guards, thus being unimpeded by [[Block]]ing, but are easily [[Dodge]]d. Other melee skills may strike so quickly they cannot be [[Dodge]]d except by excessive speed, but may be easily [[Reflect]]ed. Even other skills may be so overbearing that they cannot be [[Reflect]]ed, but can be easily [[Block]]ed by a skilled martial artist.

Melee Skills consume [[Stamina Points]]. The amount it consumes varies.
