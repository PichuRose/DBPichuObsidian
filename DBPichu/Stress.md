Each level of stress drains [[Stamina Points]]. After some amount of Stress, each consecutive Stress point drains [[Hit Points]] as well. It increases slowly, although exponentially, as you increase in levels of stress. Each level of stress is multiplicatively 1% more draining than the last, and it starts to drain [[Hit Points]] at 20 Stress Points.
