A technique used to multiply your power output. It focuses on [[Melee Damage]], [[Blocking Ability]], [[Attack Speed]], [[Dodging Ability]], and [[Movement Speed]], while being neutral or a detriment to your other stats. 

You can utilize any multiplier you please, from 2x to 100x. But beware, for the consequences of exceeding your limit of eiloken may mean draining all of your stamina and possibly health. Due to the nature of it being a technique, you may use this alongside other techniques and transformations. The level of stress on your body increases exponentially based on which transformations and techniques are in use and which level of kaioken you wish to use. 

Eiloken inflicts levels of [[Stamina Stress]] over time, which causes [[Stamina Points]] to drain. 

The amount of stress gained per second is simply equal to the multiplier of eiloken that you have. But due to the nature of stress, stacking Eiloken with another form and having high amounts of stress may mean death.
