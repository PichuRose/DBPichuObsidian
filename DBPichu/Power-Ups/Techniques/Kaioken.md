A technique used to multiply your power output. It focuses on [[Melee Damage]], [[Melee Resistance]], [[Movement Speed]], and [[Attack Speed]], while being neutral or a detriment to your other stats. 
You can utilize any multiplier you please, from 2x to 100x. But beware, for the consequences of exceeding your limit of kaioken may mean nearly instant death. Due to the nature of it being a technique, you may use this alongside other techniques and transformations. The level of stress on your body increases exponentially based on which form and which level of kaioken you wish to use.
