This is a rhythm game similar to Friday Night Funkin or other games like it. You press the notes in the right order and at the right time and if you miss too many, you lose. You'd gain progress towards a level for every note.

This particular minigame covers every trainable stat, but would very slowly increase them, so while it is very useful, it isn't really the best.

It trains the following skills:
[[Hit Points]]

[[Melee Damage]]
[[Blocking Ability]]
[[Melee Resistance]]

[[Movement Speed]]
[[Attack Speed]]
[[Dodging Ability]]


[[Ki Points]]

[[Ki Damage]]
[[Ki Resistance]]
[[Reflection Ability]]


[[Stamina Points]]

[[Power Release]]
[[Skill Cooldown]]
