Power Release dictates the maximum and minimum power output that you can use. This power output is expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%. The only way to train this is to use less than your current maximum power. The less power you are using, the more experience you will gain. Most races will start with being able to use 5-10% of your power only, but can eventually reach a point where they can use anywhere from .0...01% of their power level, up to even 200%. 

But, this is not all. Power release is also capped by your [[Hit Points]], [[Stamina Points]], and [[Ki Points]]. Each statistic governs a third of your maximum power output, but it only dips below 100% if all of your resources are below half full. Specifically, the equation for your maximum is as follows:
Max% = 100 - (1/3*(50-HP%)) - (1/3*(50-STM%)) - (1/3*(50-KI%))
So, if you are at 100% of each resource:
Max% = 100 - (1/3*(50-100)) - (1/3*(50-100)) - (1/3*(50-100)) = 100 - (-50) = 150
If you are at 0% of each resource:
Max% = 100 - 50 = 50
Max% = 100 - (2/3)*(50-100)
