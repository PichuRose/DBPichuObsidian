This minigame involves clicking on the correct space on the screen(Blue Dots). You press these as fast as possible to get more progress towards your stats. The levels get more and more dots, but eventually red dots. Accidentally clicking on a red dot makes you fail the training.

This minigame trains [[Body Stats]] and [[Mind Stats]].
