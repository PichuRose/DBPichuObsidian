This minigame you must hold spacebar, left click, or south controller button in order to keep a line within a bar. You'd gain progress towards levels as time goes on, and you'd have a bar that drains when you are failing, at the bottom. Over time, it would get harder and harder as the place to keep your line shrinks and moves.

This minigame trains [[Spirit Stats]].
