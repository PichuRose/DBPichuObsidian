Ki Skills can either do several hits individually, or add them all into a single hit.
You learn parts of Ki Skills by talking to various NPCs, or by doing quests. The most basic of ki skills, the [[Basic Ki Blast]](and it's shape) is learned immediately, but most are earned by meeting new masters. Some ki skills hit really hard, perhaps enough to break through guards, thus being unimpeded by [[Block]]ing, but are easily [[Dodge]]d. Other ki skills may strike so quickly they cannot be [[Dodge]]d except by excessive speed, but may be easily [[Reflect]]ed. Even other skills may be so overbearing that they cannot be [[Reflect]]ed, but can be easily [[Block]]ed by a skilled martial artist.

Ki Skills consume [[Ki Points]]. The amount it consumes varies.

A high level Ki technique is using your own body and spirit to use [[Genki]]. [[Genki]] skills are much more potent, but cost health to use.
