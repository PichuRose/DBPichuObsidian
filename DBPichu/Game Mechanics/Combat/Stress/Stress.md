Stress is what drains your resources over time. You naturally lose one stack of stress every second, after the effects of the stress take a toll on your body, mind, and spirit. [[Ki Stress]] drains your ki, [[Stamina Stress]] drains your stamina, and [[Health Stress]] drains your health. Each increases linearly and multiplicatively based on how many you have. Also, every 20 levels of [[Ki Stress]] gives a level of [[Stamina Stress]], and every 20 levels of [[Stamina Stress]] gives 1 level of [[Health Stress]].
